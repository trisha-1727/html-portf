<h1>Top movies according to Trisha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Loved the art style by Ghibli studio. It was not any typical common story and i found it rather interesting.</p>
<h3>Ride Your Wave</h3>
<p>The genre here is romance and it had a sad ending, but hear me out... i loved the potrayal of pure love in this and definately cried at the end.</p>
<h3>Suzume</h3>
<p>Mix of romance and mystery. I was hooked till the end and i just love it.</p>
